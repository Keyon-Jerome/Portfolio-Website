            <h2>The Robotics Emailer Bot-thing</h2>
            <h3>9/3/2018 - BLOG POST #2</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="blog-post-header">Can't really call it a bot, since it's not totally automated...</p>
              <!--  <img src="images/spartanemailsender.PNG"> -->
                <p>Every year, my robotics team needs to find sponsors for that year to fund our <a href="http://spartanrobotics.ca/sponsorship/">registration into the program and materials for the robot.</a> Sending dozens of emails can get really repetitive, and I just wished that the process could be made faster. Fortunately, with a little bit of help from the JavaMail API, it could be.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of my project, the plan was to download a database/sheet of all the emails and names of the companies in my area. I couldn't get a recent enough datasheet though, so I scrapped that even after I had already written code to parse the data. Instead of making a program that mass-emailed them all with pre-written (but unique to each company) sponsorship proposals, I decided to take a crack at JavaFX and build a UI that just asks the user to manually input the name, email, reason why said company should sponsor us, and other user/recipient details. It then fills these into a nice template and sends it off for me! I will admit, it's not the prettiest though.</p>
                <p>This program makes it <b>soo much quicker</b> to send off emails, but there is one problem with it; Email services/providers can tell that the email is being sent programmatically and alerts the recipient of the email, which could immediately turn them away. I'm a human I swear :(</p>
                <p>You can download this project on my <a href="github.com/keyon-jerome">GitHub</a> and take a look. It's not totally finished, I still want to add an HTML previewer for the email.</p>

            <h2>Mistakes In The Making of This Website</h2>
            <h3>8/1/2018 - BLOG POST #1</h3>
            <hr>
            
            <p class="blog-post-header">I'm not going to lie, making this website wasn't easy, and I think it took much longer than it should have. Here's why:</p>
            <div class ="list-container">
            <ol>
                <li>My Method of Learning</li>
                <p> I started learning CSS at the beginning of July through <a href="https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Fundamentals/417645-2.html" target="_blank">James Williamson's CSS Overview Course on Lynda.com</a>. This course is a very, very good introduction to CSS, but it didn't have any exercise files; it was just a series of videos. This meant that when I started creating my website using CSS, I had no experience actually dealing with different attributes being active at once. I had no experience actually writing any CSS. I started realizing this as I began creating this website, and had to decide whether to take a new course or learn as I went along.</p>
                <li>No Drafts = A Terrible Experience</li>
                <p>When I started writing the CSS for this website, I had NO drafts of what it was going to look like. All I had was a constantly-changing image in my head. Unfortunately, when something's just an image in your head, you can't see just how <a>ugly it will actually look...</a>
                I didn't bother making the draft because I knew if I drew it out on paper, it would look horrible either way. Later, I finally began using Adobe XD to create my drafts. This is where I really became productive with my website design; Adobe XD was simple to use and create designs with, and using it I was even able to calculate the dimensions of an element in CSS.</p>
                <li>No Content</li>
                <p>Most web designers code all of their HTML before even thinking of CSS; including the <b>content included in that HTML</b>. While coding this website, I only had placeholder content on the page. I'm talking <a>Lorem Ipsum</a> and small bits of my own text that I knew I wouldn't want to keep. This was a huge mistake that made it so much harder to design my website. I was creating styles for content that wasn't there. Writing this blog post is for example, one of the last steps before I fully deploy my website. It would've been much easier to categorize my mistakes if I'd written them out as I was facing them...</p>
